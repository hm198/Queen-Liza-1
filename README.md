Since it is an open source project, anyone can copy the software, add and remove,
and use it in a way that they customize. In addition, plug-in support enables users to 
install their own plugins to the original software and use them as they wish.
Using the bot out of purpose will explicitly ban you.
Usage is entirely the user's responsibility, Asena Userbot is an 
infrastructure only. Just as the operating system is not responsible

ıt is strictly forbidden to offer it for sale with anything. All legal investigations that may arise
the user is responsible.
